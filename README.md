## single tube circuit sculpture clock
Inspired by this [ gorgeous nixie clock](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R_9Ytw-5eY " gorgeous nixie clock"), I made this single tube clock, with esp8266 NTP timing, it  shows time every minutes by displaying every digits(also it couldn't work without wifi). It works well with a 12v1a power supply.

**Note: Be careful with high voltage,especially for cbb capacitor and other nixie tube driver components(their working voltage is approximately 200v) They should be placed in the core of the frame and should never expose to human body.**
Special thanks for the [boost circuit porvider](https://oshwhub.com/ml_m/xl6007-hui-guang-guan-sheng-ya-mu-kuai "boost circuit porvider") ,it's quite simple and works very well.
